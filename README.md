# Hoot — markets made simple 
https://use-hoot.vercel.app/

An AI owl tutor that turns any stock chart into an interactive lesson. Drag across a region of the chart and Hoot explains, in plain English, *why* the price moved — then quizzes you on it and builds flashcards from the new terms.

Built for Hook 'Em Hacks 2026 at UT Austin.

## The idea

When you open a stock chart, all you see is a line going up and down — you don't see *why*. And every explanation online assumes you already know the jargon. Hoot is a friendly tutor that sits on your shoulder while you browse the markets and explains things as you go. No finance background required.

## Features

- **Drag-to-explain charts.** Highlight any slice of a price chart and Gemini writes up what happened, ranks the drivers by importance, and flags any terms a beginner wouldn't know.
- **Auto-generated quizzes.** Every explanation spins up a short quiz tied to that exact move — driver questions, term definitions, direction calls. Earn XP for correct answers.
- **Spaced-repetition flashcards.** Terms you miss get dropped into a flashcard deck and resurfaced on a Leitner-style schedule so they actually stick.
- **Mastery dashboard.** See accuracy per topic (Macro, Earnings, Technicals, Sentiment, Risk, Market Structure) so you know what you're weak on.
- **Finance-only chatbot with live prices.** Ask the owl anything about markets. It pulls live Yahoo Finance quotes before responding, so "what's Apple trading at?" actually works — no "I don't have real-time access" cop-outs.
- **Gamified progress.** XP, ranks, and badge unlocks for hitting milestones. Progress persists locally, no account required.
- **Candles or line view.** Toggle between a smoothed line and full OHLC candles on any timeframe (1D through 5Y).

## Tech stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) with React 19 and TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion for animations
- **Charts:** Recharts + custom SVG overlays for the candle layer
- **AI:**
  - **Gemini** for region explanations and learn-pack generation (quizzes, flashcard terms, trade ideas)
  - **Groq** (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) for the conversational chatbot
- **Market data:** `yahoo-finance2` for live quotes and historical candles, Finnhub as a fallback
- **Persistence:** `localStorage` — everything stays client-side, no backend required
- **Deployment:** Vercel
